Additional
	This file is definitely going to change in structure and purpose
	This is my first attempt at a version control system and I can already
		tell that version control does some of the things I'm trying to do
		through this plain text file
	Either way, the projects that I put on github are going to be documented
		in some way, even if it's inappropriate or inefficient, I'll learn
		a better way in time and practise
